# Pumpkin Fun

A set of [pumpkin.py](https://github.com/pumpkin-py) modules.

**HELP WANTED**

This repository will be new place for many of old [Rubbergoddess](https://github.com/sinus-x/rubbergoddess) and [Amadeus](https://github.com/Czechbol/Amadeus) modules:

- Actress
- Karma
- Librarian
- Meme
- Random
- Seeking
- Points
- Shop
- and maybe even more

Check out the [issues](https://github.com/pumpkin-py/pumpkin-fun/issues) to see what is to be done and what is being worked on.

Feel free to open an Issue or even PR if you want to help us with migration to the new framework!
